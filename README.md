# Hangman-Game
In this homework assignment the core functions of a Hangman game are in place.

Some things I would like to improve:

    The coding and calling of functions in the game.js file.

    Forming an object with the data of the hangman game.

    Adding more customization using css to style the game.

    Adding sound for wins and losses.
